# Git Build Tools
This extension contains build tasks that help interacting with Git repositories.

## How to use
The extension adds the following build tasks to Visual Studio Team Services:
* [Enable Git Remote Access](https://github.com/argusnetch/vsts-git-tasks/blob/master/Tasks/EnableGitRemoteAccess/README.md)

  Updates a remote of the Git repository on the agent to allow access to the upstream repository on Visual Studio Team Service.

* [Restore Git Remote](https://github.com/argusnetch/vsts-git-tasks/blob/master/Tasks/RestoreGitRemote/README.md)

  Restores a remote of the Git repository on the agent to the original URL as set by the Visual Studio Team Services agent.
